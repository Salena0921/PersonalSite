                        Art, designing, sewing, coding…CREATING!!!! I have always had a passion for creating and
                        crafting things. Art and ceramics were my favorite subjects all the way through my high school
                        years. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the opportunity to pursue that passion in college but that
                        does not mean my thirst for everything creative has left.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Now I have thrown myself back into my creative zone first through my sewing and costume/fashion
                        design work, but I have expanded my creative juices to the web. During my coding bootcamp I
                        realized that I loved designing my webpages from picking out the right colors and font styles
                        to creating a clean layout for the elements. I took that realization and really began diving
                        into learning more about how to become a better designer and developer.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        When I am not coding you can find me with my sketch pad in my hands or you can find me behind
                        my sewing machine. Being creative is part of who I am not just something I do. I am excited how
                        far I have come but for me this a continuous journey of learning and growing. I cant wait to
                        see where else I will go…STAY TUNED FOR MORE
                        .
